# gobot
## PhD work ported to Go

One day, the whole thing will be described here.
For now, all you need to know is that this works only on OpenSimulator.

## Configuration

- Install gobot as any other Go application (`go get github.com/GwynethLlewelyn/gobot` should do the trick)
- Create a database in SQLite3 using `database/schema.sql`
- Remember that path and change `config.ini` accordingly
